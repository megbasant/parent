### Parent
This is a sample project for merging two git repositories with history and branches into a single master.

## Getting Started

The project assumes that you know git and git clone and will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.
You should also be aware of the child repositories that are planned to be moved into the root of the current directory.
We attempt to merge the code locally before the code gets pushed to the destination (parent).

```markdown
Creating a directory structure for the new repository

1. Parent Directory where the child repositories are to be moved.
2. Each child repository will have the following.
    - a master with multiple checkins and tags.
    - child repository with two or three branches.
```
